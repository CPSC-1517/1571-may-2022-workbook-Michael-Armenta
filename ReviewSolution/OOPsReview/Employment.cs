        //   private: only code within the class can alter the contents of the data

        //fully implemented property needs:
        // a) a declared storage area (data field (variable))

        //if your class definition has NO constructor coded, then the data members and/or
        //  auto implemented properties are set to the C# default data type value

        //You can code one or more constructors in your class definition
        //IF YOU CODE A CONSTRUCTOR FOR THE CLASS, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
        //  CONSTRUCTORS USED BY THE CLASS !!!!
        //
        //genrally, if you are going to code your own construtor(s) you code two types
        // First one is refered to as the Default constructor: this constructor does NOT take in any parameters
        //                                                     this constructor mimics the default system constructor
        // Second one is refered to as the Greedy constructor: this constructor has a list of parameters, one for each property,
        //                                                     declared for incoming data
        //
        // ex: (),(a),(b),(c),(d), (a,b),(a,b)(a,d)... how many constructos can I have? 2 raise power of 4 = 16 constructors are possible
        // These are a lot of contructors so that is why we have two constructors, Default (takes no data) and Greedy (takes one for each property)
        // ex: (), (a,b,c,d)
        // [] square is optional
        // syntax: accesstype classname([list of parameters])
        // {
        //  constructor code block
        // }
        //
        //IMPORTANT: The constructor DOES NOT have a return datatype
        //           You DO NOT call a construtor directly, it is called using the 
        //              new command ex:    new classname(....);
        // Default constructor
        public Employment()
        {
            //constructor body
            // a) it can be empty: values will be set to C# defaults
            // b) you COULD assign literal values to your properties with this constructor
            
            // the values that you give your class data members/properties CAN be assigned
            //      directly to a data member.
            //HOWEVER: if you have validated properties, you SHOULD consider saving your
            //         data values via the property.
            //You CAN code your validation logic within your constructors BECUASE objects 
            //  run your constructor when it is created.
            //Placing your logic in the constructor could be done if your property has
            //  a private set OR if your public data member is a readonly data member
            //Private sets and readonly data members CAN NOT have their data altered directly

            // a) a parameter for each property 
            // b) you COULD code your validation in this constructor
            // c) validation for public readonly data members MUST be done here
            // d) validation for properties with a private set MUST be done here
            //      if not done in the property.
            
            //default parameters

            //WHY? it allows the programmer to use your constructor/method without having to
            // specify all arguments in the code to your constructor/method
            
            //Location: end of parameter list
            //How many: as many as you wish.
            //values for your default parameters MUST be a valid value.
            //position and order of specified default parameters are important when the
            //  program uses the contructor/method.
            //default parameters CAN be skipped, HOWEVER, you still must account for the 
            //  skipped parameter in your argument call list using commas
            //by giving the default parameter an argument value on the call, the constructor/method
            //  default value is overridden

            //syntax: datatype parametername = default value
            //example: years on this constructor is a default parameter.

            //example: skipped defaults (3 default parameters, second one skipped)
            //  ...(string requiredparameter, int requiredparameter, int default1 = 0,
            //          int default2 = 0, int default3 = 1)
            //
            //call: ...("required string", 25, 10, , 5) default2 was skipped

            Level = level;

        }

        //a behaviour is any method in your class
